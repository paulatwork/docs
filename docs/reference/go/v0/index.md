This SDK reference provides documentation for the functions and methods in Nitric's GO library.

The library provides the ability to define and interact with cloud resources, as well as build application logic like functions/handlers.

## Installation

If you used a Nitric starter template for Go to scaffold your project, then `github.com/nitrictech/go-sdk` will already be included in the dependencies in your `go.mod` file. Using starter templates is the recommended installation option since it ensures the other files and configuration needed are also set up.

However, you can also install the SDK using `go get`.

### Using go get

```bash
go get github.com/nitrictech/go-sdk
```

## Source

The source for the SDK is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nitrictech/go-sdk).

## Go Doc

The Go reference documentation can be found here [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nitrictech/go-sdk)
